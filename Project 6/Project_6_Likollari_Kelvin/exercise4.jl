Consider now the following simple problem:

max z = 3x1 + 4x2,
    s.t. 4x1 + 3x2 ≤ 12
    4x1 + x2 ≤ 8 
    4x1 + 2x2 ≤ 8 
    x1,x2 ≥ 0.

Use the simplex method to solve this problem. What is the optimal solution? Visualise it graphically and briefly comment the results obtained (are you surprised of this outcome on the basis of your data?).
