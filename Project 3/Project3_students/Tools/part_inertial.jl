    from (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267/lecture18/lecture18.html) - written as a 
    comment for my own convenience while solving this exercise.

    Inertial Partitioning is very simple as, for a graph with 2D coordinates, it chooses a line such that 
    half the nodes are on one side of the line, and half on the other.
    This can be done as follows (in 2D, but also in 3D)
    1. Choose a straight line L, given by a*(x-xbar) + b*(y-ybar) = 0. This is a straight line through (xbar, ybar) with slope -a/b. Without loss
    of generality we assume tnat a^2 + b^2 = 1.
    2. For each node ni = (xi, yi), compute a coordinate by computing the dot product Si = -b*(xi-xbar) + a*(yi-ybar). Si is the distance from (xbar, ybar) of the projection of 
    (xi, yi) onto the line L.
    3. Find the median value Sbar of the Si's.
    4. Partition the nodes into two sets, one with Si <= Sbar, and one with Si > Sbar. The complexity of the algorithm is 
    linear. It remains to show how to pick the line L. 
    Intuitively, if the nodes are located in a long, thin region of the plane, we would want to pick L along the long axis.
    In mathematical terms, we want to pick a line such that the sum of squares of the lengths of the green lines in the figure are minimized. This is also called doing a 
    total least squares fit of a line to the nodes. In physical terms, if we think of the nodes as unit masses, we choose (x, y)
    to be the axis about which the moment of inertia of the nodes is minimized.
    This is why the method is called inertial partitioning. This means choosing a, b, xbar, ybar so that a^2 + b^2 = 1.

    #   2.  Construct the matrix M. (see pdf of the assignment)

    # as we see in the slides, matrix M is defined as an 2x2 square matrix, and at the same time symmetric as stated.
